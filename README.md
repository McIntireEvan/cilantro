# Cilantro

Inspired by [Chowdown](https://chowdown.io), but written in React. Any recipe that works in there should work in here.

# Recipe Format

As of writing, we basically use the format from Chowdown. Specifically, we use the MD front matter for much of the important info.

I'll probably support more formats later, if there are reasonable formats to import from.

# Getting Started

TODO

# Plans

Some things I'm thinking of:

- settings/themes
- Electron app?
- Have a git repo as source of truth for recipes and pull them in
- Editor to help format markdown and then prompt you to update it in your repo
